# flatten-and-reverse-functions

## FLATTEN
### List is given to me and I wrote a function which flatten list. If user wants to give input and we do not know input, how can we do this if you know connect to me.


>In this project, isinstance(i,list) code determine if its type is list or not. It is working until it is not list.

### Given input: [[1,'a',['cat'],2],[[[3]],'dog'],4,5] Expected output: [1,'a','cat',2,3,'dog',4,5]

### When you run this code, they are matching as you can see.

## Reverse of list
### List is given to me and I wrote a function which reverse list.

### Given input: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]] Expected output: [[[7, 6, 5], [4, 3], [2, 1]]

### When you run this code, they are matching as you can see.

### If user wants to give input and we do not know input, how can we do this if you know connect to me.
